## Environment Setup

This project uses environment variables for configuration:

1. Copy the example environment file to create your local environment:


2. Edit the `.env` file with your own values:
- Add your Anthropic API key (get one at https://console.anthropic.com/)
- Adjust other settings as needed

Note: The `.env` file is ignored by Git to avoid exposing your API key. Never commit sensitive credentials to the repository.
